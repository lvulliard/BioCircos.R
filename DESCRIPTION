Description: Implement in 'R' interactive Circos-like visualizations of genomic data, to map information
	such as genetic variants, genomic fusions and aberrations to a circular genome, as proposed by the
	'JavaScript' library 'BioCircos.js', based on the 'JQuery' and 'D3' technologies. The output can be
	integrated in 'R Markdown' documents, 'Shiny' applications, or by will be displayed by default in
	stand-alone HTML documents or in the 'RStudio' viewer pane.
